# Vue 3 Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for migrating the BCGov Entity repository from Vue 2 to Vue 3.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Updates
- Update core dependencies (Vue, Vue Router, Vuex)
- Update build system and configuration files
- Set up Vue 3 compatible ESLint rules

### Phase 2: Core Files Migration
- Migrate main.ts to use createApp
- Migrate router to use createRouter and createWebHistory
- Migrate store to use createStore
- Update plugin registration patterns

### Phase 3: Component Updates
- Migrate components from Options API or Class API to Vue 3 compatible syntax
- Replace deprecated features (.sync, filters, etc.)
- Implement the emits option in components that emit events
- Update v-model usage in components

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
- Update test files to use Vue Test Utils 2.x
- Test all components and features thoroughly
- Implement performance optimizations using Vue 3 features

### Phase 5: Verification and Deployment
- Install updated dependencies
- Check for deprecated or incompatible packages
- Run linters to ensure code quality
- Build the application to verify compilation
- Run all tests to validate functionality
- Test the application in development mode
- Deploy to staging environment for final validation

## Current Progress
- ✅ Completed updating core dependencies
- ✅ Completed migrating core files (main.ts, router.ts, store.ts)
- ✅ Completed component migration for App, HelloWorld, and StdHeader
- ✅ Updated unit tests for Vue Test Utils 2.x
- ✅ Updated Vuetify integration for Vue 3
- ✅ Created FormExample and ChildComponent demonstrating Vue 3 template directives
- ✅ Replaced temporary files with final versions (removed .new extensions)
- ✅ Added verification steps to migration guide

## Challenges
- Vuetify compatibility (waiting for stable Vuetify 3)
- Components using vue-property-decorator need to be refactored
- Need to update test files for Vue Test Utils 2.x

## Next Steps
1. Run verification steps to ensure migration quality:
   - Install updated dependencies
   - Check for deprecated packages
   - Run linting to validate code
   - Build application to verify compilation
   - Run tests to confirm functionality
2. Continue migrating any remaining components in other applications
3. Address Vuetify dependency when Vuetify 3 is stable
4. Deploy to staging environment for final validation
5. Monitor performance in production and apply optimizations
