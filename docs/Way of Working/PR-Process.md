**PR Process for Entities Team**
**Drafted by Severin & Shahriar on the following process for PR´s**:
Goals:  Merge code ASAP, not letting it languish 

1) When creating PRs, Assign it to yourself & wait to make sure github actions run lint and unit tests successfully before assigning reviewers.
	a) If tests don’t run automatically, dev must run them manually before assigning reviewers. 
2) Assign 2 reviewers 
3) Send a message in the registries-Entities rocketchat channel, tagging the 2 reviewers & including a link to the PR
    a) Reviewers can refuse due to load 
    b) Team can suggest others
4)  Only the person starting a conversation can resolve it. 
5) PRs must be looked at by reviewers within 24hrs of receieving the PR.
6) Last reviewer must squash and merge.
