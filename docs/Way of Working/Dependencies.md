A dependency can be identified either via:

#### How to identify dependencies across teams (make them visible)
----
- When a dependency is identified, the team - with the help of Scrum Master - should create a ticket (label as Story) in ZenHub.
- This story should be linked to the Parent Epic of the respective team by using the "Blocked By" label in ZenHub
- This ticket initially might have high level details, but over period of time or near to deadline, this should have all the details needed for the other team to action upon
- Label this ticket with "Dependency". This will help the PO's to pick this dependency up in a PO Sync. to discuss.
- Assign this ticket to the BA of the respective ..team.. whom its dependent on
- If you are aware about the Epic of the other team, where this dependency is going to be delivered, tag the Epic as well

----

#### Communication for Dependencies across team
----
- Once a ticket is created and has below information:
  - Assigned to BA
  - Have the label "Dependency"
  - Story is linked to the Epic (if you know which Epic it is) 
    - BA's can pick these tickets and start discussing in the BA guild meeting to clarify the requirements
    - If the ticket is technical in nature, this can be brought up in SoS as well so that we can RTE/SM's can cordinate the discussion
    - These tickets gets eventually discussed in PO Sync for prioritization and scheduling
