- Usage of Common componetns. When there is a change made to common components, how it needs to be communicated etc.?
  - Ideas?
1. Can we use release notes? Something like NPM packages?
  - A release note might contain a list of PR with their links by version of what has changed
      - Create a PR template to help understand what needs to be documented in the PR
    - It could be just a text document, wiki page etc.
    * Action Item: Relationship team will sync up in their team space to figure out the best way to do this?
1. Share the change in the Tech review meeting
- Technical Demo - Notification Flow
  - There is no requirement to built in other type of notificaions than email notification
  - Who is the sender? - in prod bcregistry.gov.bc.ca(probably?)
