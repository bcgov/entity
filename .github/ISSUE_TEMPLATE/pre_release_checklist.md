Prior to moving into production, the following steps should be completed or confirmed:
- [ ] Update version number in the code being released
- [ ] Ensure deployment steps are filled in - remove/replace placeholders
- [ ] Create a draft release in GitHub and confirm the correct commits are present
- [ ] Add version # and release # to this ticket
- [ ] Dev to send commit list to QA (or otherwise publish changelog)
- [ ] QA to schedule the release with staff/clients (daytime's best or when staff are available for rollback)
- [ ] All dev/test pipeline test suites green
- [ ] Dev/QA chat to plan prod verification testing (unless already automated)
- [ ] Release the code to production and complete smoke test (STEPS BELOW)
- [ ] Finalise/publish the release in GitHub, tagging it
- [ ] Merge release branch back to master (if applicable)
- [ ] Change openshift builds/pipelines back to master (if applicable)
