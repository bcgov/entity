**Definition of Ready for Sprint - User Story**
  
- [ ] Are the Acceptance Criteria defined?
- [ ] Does the user story speak to the value being created, and is understood by the team?
- [ ] Are the dependencies known/ understood? (to the our best knowledge)
- [ ] Is this user story small enough to be completed in one Sprint?
- [ ] Dev team accepts UI artifacts? (Link Design ticket within Story ticket; Better to have visual UX designs in advance)
- [ ] Is it clear whether this work is intended for deploy or limited/staged-release?
